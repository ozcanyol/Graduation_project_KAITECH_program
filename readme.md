# 📊 Sensor Data Analysis & Maintenance Prediction – Graduation Project

## 📌 Overview
This is a **Graduation Project** developed using **Python** for analyzing sensor data from engineering systems.  
The project demonstrates how to **analyze, visualize, and predict maintenance needs** using data-driven techniques.  

The project covers:  
- Data handling with **NumPy** and **Pandas**  
- Data visualization with **Matplotlib**  
- Clustering and prediction using **scikit-learn (KMeans)**  
- Engineering sensor analysis for temperature, stress, and displacement  

---

## 🛠️ Features
- Calculate **average temperature, stress, and displacement** per sensor.  
- Identify the **sensor with the highest average stress**.  
- Extract **extreme readings** (temperature > 36°C).  
- Visualize **stress over time**.  
- **Cluster sensors** using KMeans to predict maintenance requirements (`needed maintenance` vs `no maintenance needed`).  
- Structured workflow for handling and processing **real-world sensor data**.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Make sure **Python 3.x** is installed.  
2. Install required libraries:

---

## ▶️ The Program Will
- Print average metrics per sensor  
- Highlight the sensor with the highest stress  
- Plot stress over time  
- Append maintenance prediction to the dataset  

---

## 📊 Example Output
- Highest average stress: e.g., Sensor S2  
- Extreme readings extracted  
- Stress vs time plot  
- Maintenance prediction: `needed maintenance` / `no maintenance needed`  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- NumPy – Array manipulation and numerical computation  
- Pandas – Data analysis and manipulation  
- Matplotlib – Data visualization  
- scikit-learn – KMeans clustering and data preprocessing
